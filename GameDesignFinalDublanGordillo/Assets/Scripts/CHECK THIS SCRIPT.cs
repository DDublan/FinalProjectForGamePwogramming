     * OI DERECK
     * 
     * this game has a lot of confusing code so if you get confused don't hesitate to ask me about it uwu
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * TASK 1:
     * code a ui feature that shows a number above the player's head that shows how many spaces they have left
     * the player movement script is SpaceTraversal in case that helps
     * but i reccomend you look at the prefabs and see character set: it has two prefabs a character and a dice
     * which means they are nested prefabs or something idfk
     * if you look at those nested prefabs you see that they reference each other IN THE PREFAB OF CHARACTER SET which should be how you reference the ui text:
     * have the character and ui text reference each other IN THE CHARACTER SET PREFAB
     * the spacesLeft variable in the SpaceTraversal script i think would help but only after the dice has disappeared
     * you don't have to make anything fancy it's obvious i did not do tha myself
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * TASK 2:
     * code a ui feature when it's a player's turn that gives them the option to roll their dice, look at the map, or pull up an items menu
     * this would also probably be a prefab in the character set prefab
     * i already coded the dice roll and am going to code the map view so just create methods in which i can refrence from other scripts
     * so the only thing is the items menu and since you volunteered to do ui that means the items menu entirely rests in your hands have fun <3
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * TASK 3:
     * import the yuniti assets. grass, water, bamboo, bridges, all from zen forest and you can just use the folder i created for yuniti assets to import them there
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:
     * try to keep changes to a script i made to a minimum UNLESS YOU ARE ADDING SOMEHTING THAT DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH MY CODE
     * if you feel you NEED to make changes to my scripts but are unsure about changing, deleting, or adding something, ask me
     * you don't have to do all these tasks today, just try to do as many as you can
     * you don't have to do these tasks in order as they don't build off of each other, so you can do easiest first, which would probably be yuniti assets
     * when you import the yuniti assets, check github to see how many changes were made. if it's over 300 i would close the project and push origin...
     * ...to make sure we don't go over the file limit
     * AND MOST IMPORTANTLY REMEMBER TO PUSH ORIGIN WHEN YOU ARE DONE
     * 
     * and i think that's it
     * 
     * have fun gay boi
